"""uniko — async-first Python SDK for the uniko cognitive memory engine.

The compiled PyO3 extension is imported as ``uniko._uniko`` and its public
surface is re-exported here so callers write ``import uniko`` /
``from uniko import Uniko``.

Almost every method is async (returns an awaitable driven by ``asyncio``);
construction helpers and builder setters are synchronous.
