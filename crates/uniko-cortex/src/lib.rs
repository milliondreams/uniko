//! # uniko-cortex — Layer 5: Higher Reasoning
//!
//! Procedure promotion, topic detection, MCTS planning, rule induction,
//! working memory traversal, and NL-to-Cypher translation.
//!
//! Depends on `uniko-store` only.  "Layer 5" is cognitive altitude, not
//! build order: in the dependency graph this crate is a sibling of
//! `uniko-extract`, and `uniko-memory` sits *above* it — memory's
//! consolidation worker (P4, the heartbeat) calls `promote_procedures_once`
//! and `detect_topics_once` after successful consolidation cycles. P5/P6
//! are subscribers to P4, which is why memory depends on cortex and not
//! the other way around. If cortex ever needs memory's runtime APIs
//! (e.g. MCTS planning calling recall), invert via a sweep trait defined
//! in memory rather than adding a dependency here.
