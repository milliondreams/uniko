//! NLP pipeline diagnostic and audit tools.
//!
//! Every member is `#[ignore]`d and ONNX-model gated — they dump pipeline
//! output, audit CLS/NER quality, and inspect SRL frames against fixed
//! sentence sets. None run in CI. Consolidated into one binary so they link
//! once instead of once per file.
//!
//! Run an individual tool, e.g.:
//! `cargo nextest run -p uniko-extract --test nlp_diagnostics cls_quality_audit --run-ignored all --no-capture`
