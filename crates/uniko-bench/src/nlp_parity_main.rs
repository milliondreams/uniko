//! A/B parity check: uniko's in-crate NLP decode vs xervo's `NlpModel`.
//!
//! Today uniko owns tokenization + label decoding for NLP: it pulls a
//! *raw* tensor runner from xervo (`raw_tensor_model("nlp/default")`)
//! and decodes NER / POS / DEP / SRL / CLS itself in
//! `uniko_extract::nlp`. xervo 0.13 ships a higher-level `NlpModel`
//! (`runtime.nlp_model(alias).analyze(..)`) that does the decode
//! internally. Before migrating uniko onto it, we need to know whether
//! the two produce the *same* structured output.
//!
//! This binary runs both pipelines over the same single-sentence inputs,
//! backed by the *same* ONNX artifact (so any divergence is decode /
//! label-map, not model weights), and reports per-axis agreement:
//!
//! * **tokenization** — do the word/token sequences line up at all?
//! * **POS** — per-token tag agreement (only where tokens align)
//! * **NER** — entity surface-span overlap (Jaccard), plus a label
//!   correspondence table (the two label schemes differ by design:
//!   uniko collapses OntoNotes into a 10-variant enum)
//! * **DEP** — `(dependent, head, relation)` arc overlap
//! * **CLS** — sentence-class label match (shared 8-act vocabulary)
//! * **SRL** — predicate overlap and per-predicate role overlap
//!
//! It does NOT change the production catalog or call sites: it registers
//! a throwaway `nlp/parity` alias (task = `nlp`) alongside the existing
//! `nlp/default` (task = `raw`) in a scratch KB.
//!
//! Build & run:
//!   cargo build -p uniko-bench --bin nlp-parity --release
