# Why uniko

uniko is the embedded memory layer for AI agents. It links into your process like SQLite, costs
$0 to ingest, and reasons over what it stores. This page covers the problem it solves, the
category it defines, and how it compares.

---

## Agents are stateless. Memory is the missing layer.

An agent can pull text snippets from a vector store, but it cannot track who said what across
sessions, notice when a fact changes, learn a procedure from repeated experience, or explain why
it believes something. Those are different jobs, and a flat embedding index does none of them.

---

## A bolt-on stack charges you three times

The usual answer stitches together two to four systems:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Agent] --> V[Vector store<br/>Qdrant / Pinecone]
    A --> G[Graph DB<br/>Neo4j / FalkorDB]
    A --> R[Rules / inference<br/>LLM calls]
    V -.consistency glue.-> G
    G -.consistency glue.-> R
    A --> L[LLM on every write<br/>extraction]
```

- **Infrastructure cost.** Each backend is a service to deploy, secure, back up, and keep in
  sync. The graph and the vectors drift apart, and reconciling them is your problem.
- **Ingest cost.** Per-message LLM extraction is money and latency on the write path, and it makes
  ingest network-bound and offline-hostile.
- **Inference cost, paid every time.** When reasoning lives in an LLM at query time, you pay for
  the same derivation on every question.

uniko removes all three by design.

## One typed knowledge graph, in your process

Memory is a single typed knowledge graph organized around communication, living inside one
embedded database. Messages are the atomic unit; entities, observations, facts, procedures, and
topics derive from them with full provenance. The graph, the vectors, the full-text index, and the
Locy logic engine are the same database — [uni-db](https://github.com/rustic-ai/uni-db) — running
in your process.

---

## Every advantage follows from one decision

One graph, in-process, compiled at ingest. Each differentiator below is a structural consequence
of that choice.

<div class="feature-grid" markdown>
<div class="feature-card" markdown>
### Zero infrastructure
A single in-process database (uni-db) provides graph, vector, full-text, and logic in one engine.
It links into your process like SQLite — no Neo4j, no Qdrant, no network hop, nothing to keep
consistent.
</div>
<div class="feature-card" markdown>
### No LLM in the ingest hot path
Entity and observation extraction run a local ONNX NLP cascade (POS / NER / SRL / DEP / CLS) on
commodity hardware. Ingest costs **zero LLM tokens per message**; LLM work (triple refinement,
topic naming) is optional and asynchronous.
</div>
<div class="feature-card" markdown>
### Interaction-first schema
Message, Session, and Participant are first-class nodes. Everything traces back to "who said
what": Observations are statements found in Messages, Facts consolidate Observations, Procedures
promote from repeated Episodes. Provenance is the schema, not metadata bolted on.
</div>
<div class="feature-card" markdown>
### Goal-oriented working memory
Working memory is not a chat buffer. It is everything relevant to an active Goal, assembled by
traversing Goal → Task → Session → Message → Fact → Entity. Change the goal and the context
recomputes from the graph.
</div>
<div class="feature-card" markdown>
### Formal reasoning over the graph
uni-db's Locy logic layer runs rules **inside the database**. Pay extraction once at ingest, then
query compiled knowledge — facts, procedures, topics — instead of re-deriving with an LLM on every
call.
</div>
<div class="feature-card" markdown>
### Bitemporal knowledge
Facts carry BTIC temporal intervals with per-bound certainty. When a later message contradicts an
earlier one, the old fact is invalidated and the new one takes precedence — with the history
preserved, not overwritten.
</div>
</div>

!!! note "Compile once, query forever"
    Raw messages are the source code. Consolidation compiles them into Facts and Procedures, and
    the recall cascade queries that compiled knowledge — never the raw stream. Extraction is paid
    once; every subsequent query benefits.

!!! note "Reasoning runs inside the database"
    Procedure promotion invokes the `sequence_detector` Locy rule via a `QUERY` goal-query, turning
    repeated Episodes into reusable Procedures — benchmarked end to end. See
    [Reasoning with Locy](guides/reasoning-with-locy.md) for the full picture.

## How uniko compares

uniko is the only embedded, zero-infrastructure memory system in its class, and it backs that with
the numbers that gate a production deployment: **$0 ingest cost, 33–76× faster ingest than graph
backends, and the fastest Q&A latency of any system measured (4.04s)**. The tables below are
head-to-head, every figure quoted from the source reports.

### Where everyone sits

| System | Architecture | LoCoMo |
|---|---|---|
| **Mem0** | Vector + SQLite + optional entity boost | 91.6% |
| **Graphiti** (Zep) | Temporal knowledge graph (Neo4j / FalkorDB) | 75–84% |
| **Letta** (MemGPT) | PostgreSQL + agent-managed memory blocks | 74.0% |
| **LangMem** | LangGraph BaseStore, vector-only | 58.1% |
| **Cognee** | Graph + Vector + Relational + Cache | — |
| **uniko** | Single embedded uni-db (graph + vector + FTS + Locy) | **81.2%** |

uniko scores **81.2%** on the full LoCoMo10 (1,986 questions), with retrieval hit **85.6%**, F1
**0.321**, and total LLM cost of **$3.55** (gemini-3.1, 2026-05-26, using Mem0's verbatim judge
prompt) — delivered from one embedded graph instead of a stack of external services.

!!! note "Different systems require different infrastructure"
    Every competitor requires an external service: Graphiti needs Neo4j or FalkorDB, Mem0 needs a
    vector store such as Qdrant, Cognee needs Graph + Vector + Relational backends. uniko runs
    entirely in-process.

### Cost and latency vs the KTH dmas-memory baseline

uniko's strongest measured ground is **ingest throughput / cost** and **end-to-end query latency**.
The figures come from the KTH dmas-memory comparison (Wolff & Bennati, KTH,
[arXiv:2601.07978](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07978)), measured 2026-06-14, unconstrained network
mode, over the same LoCoMo10 question set.

!!! note "Two question sets — don't conflate them"
    The 81.2% judge figure above is the full 1,986-question LoCoMo10 run; the KTH cost and latency
    tables below use the 1,540-question non-adversarial subset.

=== "Loading (ingest) — full 5,882-turn corpus"

    | System | Total $ | Tokens | Wall (min) | per-turn ms |
    |---|---|---|---|---|
    | **uniko** | **~$0** | **0** (local NLP) | **7.5** | **76** |
    | full_context | $0.00 | 0 | 21.08 | ~215 |
    | rag | $0.006 | 308k | 40.29 | ~411 |
    | cognee | $1.32 | 6.7M | 493.47 | ~5031 |
    | mem0 | $4.82 | 51.7M | 250.95 | ~2560 |
    | graphiti | $5.49 | 34.6M | 568.97 | ~5804 |

    uniko ingests the full corpus in **7.5 minutes at $0 API cost**, making **zero LLM API calls
    during ingest**. Against the graph backends (Graphiti, Cognee) it is **33–76× faster** at the
    per-turn level and avoids $1.32–$5.49 of ingest cost per corpus.

=== "Q&A — per question (1,540 questions)"

    | System | Answer $/q | Total $ | Avg wall | Total tok |
    |---|---|---|---|---|
    | mem0 | $0.000179 | $0.28 | 4.56s | 1235 |
    | rag | $0.000259 | $0.40 | 4.34s | 1790 |
    | **uniko** | $0.000657 | $1.01 | **4.04s** | **2468** |
    | graphiti | $0.000657 | $1.01 | 6.20s | 4546 |
    | cognee | $0.000715 | $1.10 | 6.99s | 4780 |
    | full_context | $0.006786 | $10.45 | 9.51s | 45708 |

    uniko has the **fastest Q&A wall time of all six systems** (4.04s) and uses **half the total
    LLM tokens per query** of either graph backend (2468 vs Graphiti 4546, Cognee 4780). Its answer
    cost is driven by a larger retrieved context (2435 input tokens) — a recall-budget setting you
    tune, not an architectural floor.

!!! tip "The one-line summary from the KTH comparison"
    uniko is the only system of six that ingests LoCoMo in under 10 minutes at $0 API cost, and the
    only one with sub-4-second mean Q&A wall-time. Against the graph backends it is 33–76× faster at
    ingest and uses half the LLM tokens per query.

## Who uniko is for

uniko is a **Rust library** that embeds cognitive memory into your agent's process. It fits when:

- **You want zero operational footprint.** No external graph DB, no vector store, no managed
  service. The whole memory system — database, NLP cascade, embeddings, optional reranker — runs
  in-process on consumer hardware.
- **Ingest cost and offline capability matter.** Local extraction means predictable, $0-token
  ingest with no per-message network dependency.
- **Conversation and provenance are central.** You track who said what across many sessions,
  attribute statements to speakers, and explain why a fact is believed — not just retrieve nearby
  text.
- **You organize memory around goals.** Working memory assembled by traversing
  Goal → Task → Session is a first-class concept, not something you reconstruct yourself.
- **You value graph-native reasoning.** Facts, procedures, and topics are compiled at ingest and
  queried directly, with Locy logic available inside the database.

uniko is built for what no other shipping system offers: an embedded, conversation-native,
goal-oriented memory graph with formal reasoning, at zero ingest cost. If your product depends on
remembering people, facts, and procedures across sessions — in your own process — this is the layer
for it.
